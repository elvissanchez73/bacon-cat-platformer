## Character Arcs

### Bacon Cat
- **Start**: Ordinary kitten living peaceful breakfast life, somewhat lazy and humorous
- **Journey**: Forced into hero role, discovers inner courage and determination.  Learns to use bacon powers.  Saves friends one by one, gaining confidence. 
- **End**: Confident hero who proved cats are brave, smart, and capable.  Still goofy, but now with purpose. 

### Dr. Woofer
- **Motivation**: Believes dogs deserve to rule over cats.  Jealous of the peace and power Purrville had with the Legendary Sandwich. 
- **Backstory**: Once friends with Elder Whiskers in younger days, but grew bitter and power-hungry
- **Arc**: Remains villainous but shown as complex - not pure evil, just misguided and jealous.  Escapes to return another day (sequel hook).

### The Rescued Kittens
- Represent hope, friendship, and teamwork
- Each one gives Bacon Cat a piece of power/knowledge, showing that alone he'd fail, but together they're strong
- By the end, they symbolize the community Bacon Cat fought to save

## Themes

1. **Courage in the Face of Fear**: Bacon Cat is scared but acts anyway
2. **Community Over Individualism**: Can't win alone - needs rescued kittens' help
3. **Good vs Evil (with nuance)**: Dr. Woofer isn't cartoonishly evil - he's jealous and misguided
4. **Home and Belonging**: Fighting for Purrville because it's HOME
5. **Humor in Adversity**: Even in darkest moments, Bacon Cat cracks jokes (hates Tuesdays, bacon puns)
